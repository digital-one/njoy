      <p><strong>Welcome to AC.NJOY.com.</strong></p>

<p>This is a message from our lawyers. Yes it’s SUPER boring, but it’s also important and you should read it. It’s not that long...</p>

<p>If you visit or shop on AC.NJOY.com, you agree to accept these conditions, and those described in the NJOY Privacy Policy. Please go through those carefully too. In addition, when you use AC.NJOY.com, you are subject to our guidelines and conditions.</p>

<p>All authorized retailers of the Artist Collection agree:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1. The Artist Collection is a premium e-liquid line and it needs to be priced appropriately. So, you agree to price the Artist Collection product at $23 per bottle. If your shop offers the Artist Collection for a price below $23 we won’t like that, and you may be delisted as an authorized retailer. That would suck.</li>
  <li>2. We call it the Artist Collection because it’s a collection! The flavors need to be kept together. So, you agree to maintain an inventory of all five flavors in the Artist Collection line, which means no cherry picking! You will make best efforts to offer the entire Artist Collection in your shop together.</li>
  <li>3. The Artist Collection looks best without all that ugly plastic that keeps it safe on the way to your shelves. So, you agree to remove the shrink-wrap from the product before displaying it in your shop or selling it to your customers.</li>
  <li>4. We designed our boxes to look insanely great, and the Artist Collection looks very pretty as a group, don’t you think?  So you agree to display all Artist Collection product boxes and bottles together. You will sell more that way anyway, and we want what you want… you to be successful. </li>
</ol>
